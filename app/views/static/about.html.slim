						| My name is Vanessa Amilet Santos, a Houston-native living in ATL &#x1f351;. I'm a web designer and developer with over 9 years of experience. Throughout my experience I have worked as an in-house designer and developer in the Tech, Construction, Energy, and Oil & Gas industries. I have also worked independently as a freelancer, helping companies of all sizes and different industries throughout the nation. This has helped me gain insight on the importance of creating engaging and user-friendly designs that focus on the customer journey. My goal is to elevate your web presence with unique strategic bold websites.
