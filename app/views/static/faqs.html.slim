						#collapseSeven.accordion-collapse.collapse aria-labelledby="headingSeven" data-bs-parent="#accordion" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"
							.accordion-body itemprop="text"
								p I design and develop a different range of websites. I worked on everything from e-commerce websites to microsites. I have also worked with clients from different industries, such as software, event planning, human resources, arts, and much more.

						h2.accordion-header#headingFour itemprop="name"
							button.accordion-button.collapsed type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseFour" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseFour"
								| Do you need all of my content before you can get started?
						#collapseFour.accordion-collapse.collapse aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-bs-parent="#accordion" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"
							.accordion-body itemprop="text"
								p I certainly do! Almost all projects will require content up front. Design is a little like the love child of tetris and a jigsaw puzzle – we have to consider all elements and understand the overall intended outcome before we even start to fit the pieces together. I don’t only have to consider the relationship between images and text (for example) but things like the amount of copy you provide, the number of images and even the orientation of the photos effects the design I produce. After I receive your brief, I’ll have a chat to you to discuss if we need to tailor elements of my process to suit your project.

						h2.accordion-header#headingThree itemprop="name"
							button.accordion-button.collapsed type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseThree"
								| What is a responsive website?
						#collapseThree.accordion-collapse.collapse aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordion" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"
							.accordion-body itemprop="text"
								p A responsive website is designed to automatically shrink and expand when viewed on a desktop, a tablet or a smartphone. By having a website that is easily viewed on mobile devices means that you give far greater access to your online content to your viewer. With the introduction of the iPhone and iPad, the use of mobile website viewing has had a staggering increase of users. Getting your website designed as a responsive site is almost essential for the future viewing of your site as more and more people go mobile. Yes, I do design responsive websites!

						h2.accordion-header#headingFive itemprop="name"
							button.accordion-button.collapsed type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseFive" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseFive"
								| Can I update my website on my own?
						#collapseFive.accordion-collapse.collapse aria-labelledby="headingFive" data-bs-parent="#accordion" itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer"
							.accordion-body itemprop="text"
								p Yes, you will be able to update your website as you wish. I build all websites with a user-friendly content management system, such as Wordpress and Shopify. A content management system is software that keeps track of every piece of content on your website, much like your local library keeps track of books and stores them. Content can be simple text, photos, music, video, documents, or just about anything you can think of.
