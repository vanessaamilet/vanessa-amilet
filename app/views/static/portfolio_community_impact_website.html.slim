					p.lead Drio Duo partnered with me to contribute to the development of a redesigned website for a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing education, financial security, and health equity. My work focused on restructuring the site within WordPress to improve navigation, performance, and overall usability. The updated website provides a more intuitive, user-friendly experience that makes it easier for visitors to access resources and engage with the organizationâ€™s mission.
